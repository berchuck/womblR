## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the Description section of DESCRIPTION to be more appropriate.

* Addressing the comment "Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?". 
  
  -There is currently no reference for this methodology. There is a paper that is to be submitted to a journal in the next month and then a version of the manuscript will be placed on arXiv.org. I plan on updating the womblR R package with the arXiv.org reference when it is available (and then the journal reference when it is published). 

## Test environments
* Mac: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit), R 3.3.0
* Linux: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit), R 3.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* New submission

###This is a new submission, so this NOTE can not be removed. But, it does not impact the build of the package.
